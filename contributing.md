# Contributing to Hierarchical Autonomous Agent Swarm (HAAS)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Hierarchical Autonomous Agent Swarm (HAAS) project. This document outlines the process for contributing in a way that is efficient and aligns with the project's goals.

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Watch the Latest YouTube Video**: Stay updated with the project's progress and priorities by watching the latest video updates from Dave, the project owner.

2. **Discuss on the Discussions Tab**: Engage with the community by discussing ideas, suggestions, and feedback related to the latest updates on the GitHub Discussions tab.

3. **Create an Issue**: If you identify a bug or have a feature request, create an issue on GitHub detailing your findings or suggestions.

4. **Submit a PR**: Once you've discussed your idea and created an issue, you can fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request (PR) for review.

## Ground Rules for Commenting and Contributing

1. **Stay on Topic**: Discussions should be relevant to the project's current scope and topics presented in the latest YouTube update. Off-topic discussions, meta commentary, or attempts to change the project's scope will be removed. Repeated violations may lead to a ban.

2. **Adhere to the C3P0 Policy**: We follow the Collaborative Culture Community Policy: Zero Tolerance (C3P0) for harmful behavior and time-wasting. [C3P0 Policy](https://github.com/daveshap/C3P0).

3. **PR Requirements**: All PRs must include a clear description. Limit submissions to one PR per day, ensuring it adheres to the project's style and structure. Refraining from reformatting, refactoring, or restructuring the project is crucialâ€”non-compliant PRs will be rejected.

4. **Examples and Demos**: All PRs must include examples and demos along with the code. This can be documented in a README, a link to a video, or screenshots. But we need to ensure that it's clear we understand what the code does.
